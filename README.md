 # Rust Renamer
 This was my first rust project, I used it to rename files I'm sent in a efficient manner.

 ### Todo
 I'd like to add a config.toml file to set up multiple file renaming schemes, along with other settings I'd possibily need.
 A GUI to drag and drop files would also be nice but thats not specifically needed with how it currently works.
