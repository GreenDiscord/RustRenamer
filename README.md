 # Rust Renamer
 This was my first Rust project, I use it to rename files I'm sent efficiently.

 ### Todo
 I want to add a config.toml file to set up multiple file renaming schemes, along with other settings I'd possibly need.
 A GUI to drag and drop files would also be nice but that's not specifically needed with how it currently works.
